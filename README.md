This code is specifically designed for the Command Timer Spigot plugin, not for websites or anything else.

It works for versions 1.20+ or 1.21+, as long as the Command Timer plugin is updated to those versions.

Installation Steps:
Drop the keyall.json file into the Command Timer plugin folder:
commandtimer/timers/put it here (keyall.json)

As for the config.yml, it’s optional. You can use it or not. If you want to use it, just replace the default config.yml with your custom one.

That’s it, you’re good to go!

Peace out!
